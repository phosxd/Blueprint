Providing your own fixes or your own improvements are very welcome! There are just a few rules you should consider before submitting your contribution.
- Sections of code should be clearly explained with comments or descriptions.
- No large sections of artificially generated text or code should be submitted.
- Any code changes should follow the existing code-style. This is not strictly enforced but helps reduce code reformatting.
